            <h2>What exactly is Machine Learning.</h2>
            <p>When most pepole hear "Machine learning" they picture a robot: a deadly terminator or if you are an avengers fan then it would be Ultron.</p>
            <p>But Machine learning is just not a fantacy, it's been around us for a while now. The only fact is that we are not recognizing it. Below is an example of an ML application, some of you may have heard it before.</p>
            <p>Optical character Recognition(OCR) or optical character reader is the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo or from subtitle text superimposed on an image, more on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition">OCR.</a></p>
            <p>or in simple words Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, is a technology that enables you to convert different types of documents, such as scanned paper documents, PDF files or images captured by a digital camera into editable and searchable data.</p>
            <p>The OCR uses Convolutional-Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN). These columns are fed into a deep-bidirectional long short term memory (LSTM) cell, which provides a sequence, identifying the relationship between the characters.</p>

        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <div class="python" >
            <p>This site is gonna assume that use have atleast some basic understading of python programming.</p>
            <p>If you are not familiar with python then it's now a good time to start. I have learned python from these sites which i found very useful.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="numpy">
            <p>And that you are familiar with Python's main scientific libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, sklearn</p>
        </div>

        <div class="math">
            <p>Also, many people asked me, even i asked many people at the time i've started Machine learning is "Do, i need mathametics?".</p>
            <p>The answer is pretty obvious, yes you need math in order to know whats in under the wood.</p>
            <p>If you ask me, i would suggest you to have basic collage level understading of calculas, Statistics, probability, linear Algebra.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="codeeditor">
            <p>I have provided code examples for better understading of the problem if you want run them on your own and see the results feel free to use the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/" >Google colab</a> </p>
            <p>If you want to run code in your local machine, then you should probably use jupyter</p>
            <p>If you are not familiar with jupyter or any other scientific libraries mentioned above the jupyter notebook have tutorials built-in itself. And there is aslo a quick math tutorial for linear Algebra.</p>
