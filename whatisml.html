            <h2>What exactly is Machine Learning?</h2>
            <p>When most pepole hear "Machine learning" they picture a robot: a deadly terminator or if you are an avengers fan then it would be Ultron.</p>
            <p>
                But Machine learning is just not a fantacy, it's been around us for a while now. The only fact is that we are not recognizing it. Below is an example of an ML application, some of you may have heard it before.

                <b>Optical character Recognition(OCR)</b> or <b>optical character reader</b> is the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo or from subtitle text superimposed on an image, more on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition">OCR.</a>
            </p>
            <p>or in simple words Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, is a technology that enables you to convert different types of documents, such as scanned paper documents, PDF files or images captured by a digital camera into editable and searchable data.</p>
            <p>The OCR uses Convolutional-Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN). These columns are fed into a deep-bidirectional long short term memory (LSTM) cell, which provides a sequence, identifying the relationship between the characters.</p>
